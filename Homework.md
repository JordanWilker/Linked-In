A rough draft message that I can use to is "Hey, this is Jordan Wilkerson, we used to know each other from .... I think it would be beneficial to connect with each other so we can share opportunities."
I have no idea if this is good, as I am very bad at communicating with people online, so please let me know. I don't know if it is to casual or not.

Some people I would like recommendations from is my former Boss, Wes Yahara, my current Boss, Kersey Alstrom, and if I finish strong, Boise Code Works.

There are many people I have sent requests to, from friends who are in the business world, to co-workers and leaders at the YMCA. I have also sent some requests to other students at
codeworks
